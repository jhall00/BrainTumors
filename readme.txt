Download dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri

2 jupyter notebook files (one for ResNet, one for DenseNet)

In the notebooks we loaded the data in from a directory named "BrainTumorData". Within that folder there 
are two folders from the downloaded dataset, "Training" and "Testing". 


We have saved the models we used for DenseNet (The one with data aumentation is myModelDenseNet and the 
one without is myModelDenseNet2)
